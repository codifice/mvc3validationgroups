# mvc3validationgroups
_The latests snapshot of the old MVC3 Validation Groups source from CodePlex._

Implements web forms style validation groups using MVC3 unobtrusive validation on the client and server side. This is intended to improve the UX experience of validation messages by allowing smaller summaries to be grouped close to their related fields rather than a single large summary.
